"""
ITFlow Quick Ticket - Linux tray app

Lets end users submit an ITFlow support ticket (with an optional full-screen
screenshot) in a few clicks, without logging in to the client portal.

Configuration is read from (in order of preference):
  1. /etc/itflow-quick-ticket/config.json   (system-wide, set by install.sh / RMM)
  2. ~/.config/itflow-quick-ticket/config.json
  3. config.json next to this script / the packaged binary

See config.json for the expected fields. Shared UI/logic lives in
../common/core.py.

Notes:
  - The tray icon requires a system tray host. On GNOME this means the
    "AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support" extension (or a similar
    indicator extension) must be enabled.
  - Screenshot capture uses Pillow's ImageGrab, which on Linux shells out to
    `scrot`, `grim`, `maim`, or `slurp` (one of these must be installed).
